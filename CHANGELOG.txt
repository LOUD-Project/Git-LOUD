Lua 5.3.28

- AI can now adapt its multiplier in response to certain factors. If the corresponding lobby global option is set to "Time-Based", the AI will increase its multiplier by 0.02 every 6 minutes. If the option is set to "Ratio-Based", all AI will increase their multipliers up to a max of 0.5 based on the relative size of their land army ratio to that of their enemies.
- New AI multiplier options: 1.45 and 2.5.
- Two new units:
  - Deluge - Aeon Experimental Dreadnought, equipped with a downsized Salvation cannon and personal shield.
  - Xiphos - Cybran T3 Interdiction Gunship, equipped with potent weaponry and a rearward anti-missile system.
- The buff system now works on AI on a per-brain basis.
- Several land and amphibious platoons have received new names to indicate type.
- Platoon control value and land ratio restriction tweaks.
- Simplified some factory unit construction conditions.
- The UsingTransports flag will prevent a platoon from being considered during MERGE operations.
- New custom behaviour for torpedo bomber platoons.
- Removed some deprecated platoon categories.
- Correct RTBLocation to keep platoons from always defaulting to the origin base.
- FIX: FINDPOINTMEETSCONDITIONS was evaluating minimum threat at 'less than' rather than 'less than or equal' - resulted in failure to find positions with 0 threat.
- FIX: FINDTARGETINRANGE was not checking properly for BlockingTerrain when filtering results.
- Reduced some mergelimits.
- Added Type 1 Land Attack formation.
- MEX Attack Large Need Mass - changed condition and local targeting priorities.
- Some formation limits changed.
