 |--> Choose the size of cities ("Small" is recommended for maps over 20x20km to prevent lag).
- New mod: BrewLAN Bletchley Park. A rebalance which separates Tech 3 Radar and Omni Sensors into two different buildings per faction (except Seraphim).
 |--> This mod also adds the Teatut; a UEF Experimental Mobile Omni Sensor, which works only in one direction at a time.
- New mod: BrewLAN Metal World.
 |--> Another "mutator" mod like those added recently; removes all mass points and allows building mass extractors anywhere.

- Fix: Prevent entering a negative Timed Cheat Limit (this should never have been possible, and would break the game).
- Fix: Make feedback- and time-based cheating add together properly (timed would briefly override feedback). 
- Fix: Starting location markers in the lobby Map Preview didn't have colours.
- Fix: The Conquest Class (UEF Experimental Battleship) will no longer try to shoot at satellites with its anti-air guns.
- Fix: Some maps could not show a minimap or cartographic view. Thanks to code from FAF, this has been resolved.

 |--> Many are unbalanced on purpose. Your mileage may vary.
 |--> The craziest of them can be found under the "Mutators" folder in the mod manager, but some are under "Unofficial Rebalances".
 |--> There are a total of 16, so for more information on them, read their descriptions from the mod manager.
- UI Party has been compatibilized for LOUD; its beta release is in this update.
 |--> Almost all of its settings are off by default.
- New UI mod: Disperse Move.
 |--> Give a group of units a queue of move orders, then use a hotkey to distribute the orders among them.

 |--> All categories are now folders.
 |--> Button to remove a key from an action without changing it to a different key.
 |--> Search for a key or action by name.

 |--> Since the Advanced Stealth Field Generators added by this mod are upscales of existing units, they no longer have copies of their meshes, textures, and animations.
 |--> This has no effect on game performance or appearance, except for saving about 8 MB of RAM.
- Now that BrewLAN Baristas is under the "Miscellaneous" folder, its "UTIL" prefix is redundant, and has been removed.

 |--> When this function is enabled, trying to select both air and land units will remove air units from the final selection.
 |--> Holding shift will temporarily disable this function.
- New mutator mod: Tanksy's Experiments 1: Combat Changes.
 |--> This mod is for users who want more realistic ranges in their games; unit ranges vary from 2 to 3 times their original values.
 |--> Changes are also made to muzzle velocities and weapon firing arcs to account for these range differences.
- Fixed d3d_WindowsCursor getting turned off (and thus bringing back the NVIDIA driver lag bug) every second match started per application session.
- AI: a revision to how PriorityFunctions are handled by the PlatoonFormManager.
 |--> Previously, PFM tasks did NOT get PriorityFunction reviews unless the PFM tasks were sorted.
 |--> This only occured when the primary status of the location changed (not very often).

- All unit wrecks have 60% of their previous value to reduce penalization for aggressive play.
- Fix Unit Database (under Main Menu -> Extras) not having a background panel (and thus make it usable).
- The LOUD Standard button no longer enables Barista, Supreme Economy, Auto Mass Fab Manager and Sequential Mex Upgrade.
- Made the Sequential Mex Upgrade tooltip more accurate. Thanks to MostLostNoob#6672.
- AI: Engineers' sensitivity to nearby threat has been tuned. Threat must now be closer (400 <- 450) and larger (75 <- 30) to trigger most defensive land defence builders.
- AI: Moved the triggers for some engineer functions and several land formations based upon land ratio, keeping them in action a little longer.
- AI: Small increase in radius of base patrol (was running into the perimeter defenses).
- AI: Allowing T3 construction to continue to a slightly higher ratio and curbing T3 MML production at an earlier point.

- Unit Database. Under Main Menu -> Extras, this is a screen that allows searching through and reading detailed information on all the units in the LOUD mod pack.
- BrewLAN RNG: Lucky Dip. A mod by Balthazar which, for each player, restricts the player from building all but one unit of any given type.
 |--> For example, out of the 4 Tech 3 Anti-Air units the UEF has, a UEF player will only be able to build 1.
 |--> Currently requires all of the unit mods included with LOUD as standard.
 |--> The LOUD port of this mod is in an alpha version, and subject to change. Feedback is appreciated as always.
- The economy of artillery has been overhauled. Energy consumption of artillery weapons is now formulaically derived from their damage and area-of-effect. This results in many weapons consuming more energy.
- Mild increases to energy storage for almost all energy related buildings, including mass fabricators. Seraphim buildings benefit more from these buffs.
- The fake UEF Tech 3 Sonar is no longer in the Seraphim unit roster as an upgrade to the Sera T2 Sonar. It has been replaced with BrewLAN's Sera T3 Sonar.

 |--> All veterancy requirements multiplied by 1.4.
 |--> Damage multiplier versus shields reduced from 0.8 to 0.5.
 |--> Energy cost per shot increased from 0 to 24150 (drained at 2300 per second), resulting in a 10.5 second charge cycle before firing.
 |--> Acceleration reduced from 0.8 to 0.6 o-grids per second squared.
 |--> Maximum speed increased from 2.4 to 2.7 o-grids per second.
 |--> Maximum brake speed reduced from 2.4 to 0.9 o-grids per second.

- Make AI build more shields when it is losing the land battle.
- Make AI build more AA when it is losing the air battle.
- Fixed issues preventing the AI from building any naval bases on 10km x 10km maps.
- Make the AI keep Tech 2 and Tech 3 production going longer if it is winning the land battle.
- AI: Some of the threat logic behind alerts and build conditions now factor in AI cheat multiplier, distance, and the AI's land ratio. 
- A triple wrench icon now indicates the build power statistic in the unit mouseover details.

- Large-scale reorganization of AI unit compositions and building priorities.


### Release 18-12-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.30

- Automatic call of a console command to fix performance problems related to recent NVIDIA driver updates.
- AI multipliers can now be set via a text box.
- Time-based adaptive cheat can now work negatively, allowing an AI to become an easier opponent as the game progresses. This can make for a more potent early game -- when LOUD is normally most vulnerable -- while “levelling out” with players in the middle and later games, when LOUD’s advantages begin to add up.
- All the most advanced AI lobby options are now in their own category at the bottom of the list.
- Feedback-based adaptive cheat, when combined with time-based adaptive cheat, now works based on the current actual cheat instead of the cheat which the AI started with.

- AI: Naval reinforcement requirements lowered slightly.
- AI: Improved air staging.
- AI: Improved reaction time of base distress responses.
- Base Alerts will prevent the Dead Base Monitor from closing a base until the alerts have expired. This was causing a fair number of alert units to get 'stuck' at a base that was closed during an alert.
- AI pings are somewhat less intrusive.
- AI: A very minor reduction in how much threat transport platoons will accept.
- AI: Some adjustment to bomber formations, requirements and targeting conditions, tether ranges, etc.

- All teleport times are now 12 seconds, and energy costs for teleportation have been revised across the board. Strict minimums have been put in place to prevent instant or free teleports.
- Higher limit on battleships for certain AI naval formations.
- Higher unit cap thresholds after which the AI will not build airpads or antinuke launchers.
- AI SACUs are more likely to be drawn to bases without factories than bases which have them already.
- The AI may start building new factories earlier if the conditions are suitable.
- The AI is more willing to carry out amphibious attacks.
- The AI is more willing to build naval yards if an enemy is close.
- Neutral civilians do not factor into the AI's assessment of threat anymore.
- Several bots which mistakenly had tank icons now have bot icons.
- Multiple experimentals have icons which better reflect their actual weapon loadouts.
- Default values for anti-teleportation field range.
- Numerous other bug fixes which improve the AI's capabilities.


### Release 04-12-2020 ###
Textures 6.01
BrewLAN 0.84
Lua 5.3.28

- AI can now adapt its multiplier in response to certain factors. If the corresponding lobby global option is set to "Time-Based", the AI will increase its multiplier by 0.02 every 6 minutes. If the option is set to "Ratio-Based", all AI will increase their multipliers up to a max of 0.5 based on the relative size of their land army ratio to that of their enemies.
- New AI multiplier options: 1.45 and 2.5.
- Two new units:
 |--> Deluge - Aeon Experimental Battleship, equipped with a downsized Salvation cannon and personal shield (courtesy of a commission by Darkdessy#4719).
 |--> Xiphos - Cybran T3 Interdiction Gunship, equipped with potent weaponry and a rearward anti-missile system (courtesy of a commission by RD#0568).
- The buff system now works on AI on a per-brain basis.
- Several land and amphibious platoons have received new names to indicate type.
- Platoon control value and land ratio restriction tweaks.
- Simplified some factory unit construction conditions.
- The UsingTransports flag will prevent a platoon from being considered during MERGE operations.
- New custom behaviour for torpedo bomber platoons.
- Removed some deprecated platoon categories.
- Correct RTBLocation to keep platoons from always defaulting to the origin base.
- FIX: FINDPOINTMEETSCONDITIONS was evaluating minimum threat at 'less than' rather than 'less than or equal' - resulted in failure to find positions with 0 threat.
- FIX: FINDTARGETINRANGE was not checking properly for BlockingTerrain when filtering results.
- Reduced some mergelimits.
- Added Type 1 Land Attack formation.
- MEX Attack Large Need Mass - changed condition and local targeting priorities.
- Some formation limits changed.
- Rewrite of guardpoint code. Improved guard response while on station - validated merging process.
- Buffs are now prevented from applying to civilian units.
- Revised and described most of the DEBUG switches available in LOUD.
- Some AI debug functions have been better documented.


### Release 27-11-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.27

- New and updated Naval Air formations for guarding naval flotilla with fighter, gunships and torpedo bombers.
- New behaviours for using guardpoint logic.
- Revised AttackForceAI behaviours, increasing targeting rate and general responsiveness. Searchradius has also been refined.
- AI will not build T1 p-gens if any more advanced power is under construction.
- Increased econ and time allowances for building new factories (5 mins down to 2.5).
- AI LifeThread - prevents eco crashes by compensating for any resource consumption which brings the net income below 0 when supply is empty. Tied to ACU and shuts off if the com dies.
- AI function: ClearOutBase. Directs units to new primary bases.
- Attack planner fixes, and logging additions.
- New math for exponential distance valuation when examining targets.
