- Check Blocking Terrain functions have been standardized & optimized and use a less aggressive step size ( 6 >> 8 ogrids )
- Fighter squadrons have enhanced distress response behaviors
- AI Platoons can now pass along the WaypointSlackDistance value, useful in pathed movement, recognizing 'arrival' at waypoints
- minor size reductions to some of the largest land platoons to alleviate pathed movement issues
- MOVEPLATOON now uses a scaling delay while 'watching' platoons, with improved stall detection and response to stalls
- revised MERGEINTO functions to narrow the scope of when this type of merge can happen
- fixed a bug in BaseMonitorGetDistressLocation that would report a location of { 0,0,0 }
- previously, the Platoon Form manager would only check priority functions when bases changed status (Primary or Not Primary)
- The PFM will now check priority functions, and resort the available platoons, with each cycle of the PFM
- Intel routine was not recording the LastUpdate value in the HiPri table - causing platoons to abort HiPri targets
- revised how platoons utilize the HiPri target list for more consistent target acquistition.


Textures, Projectiles

- various icon and projectiles updates to support BO ACU and others

Black Ops Advanced ACU 

- this is a major overhaul and rebalancing change affecting every aspect of the mod and it's relation to LOUD
- In general, enhancements (except top end ones) are less costly & relate directly to weapons/features, already found in the game
- The Left Arm, Engineering line, has more crossover between the Combat, and Engineering  line in terms of secondary weapons and stats
- The Engineering line significantly enhances the ACU mobility as you progress (upto 18% faster)
- The Combat Engineering line significantly slows the ACU as you pack on more armor (upto 12% slower)
- All ACU are now Radar and Sonar Stealth by default - some can expand that into a full sized 'field' with certain enahancements
- All ACU now have a basic tac missile/torpedo defense ability by default - no longer requires a discrete weapon in the blueprint

### Release 18-11-2022

LUA 6.2.17
LOUD_MISC 6.2.13

    - updated ACU enhancement descriptions to match with buff values being applied (thanks LostNoob, others)
    - trapped the -1.@IND problem in the scoreboard - seems to be internal but applied logging for it (thanks Lohkrim for replay)
    - more UI work to capture the overcharge weapons better (SERA SACU audio)
    - cleanup of some code around the order panel change from last patch
    - the HotStats mod, which I love, has it's sample period go from 10 - to 12 seconds - reducing memory slightly
    - removal of some redundant campaign code in the Supreme Scoreboard
    
    - the UI should now be accurately showing regen values accurately - rather than being drawn from a description field
    - try driving a Sera unit thru a restoration field now - you should see the values reflect properly
    - likewise, shields will show proper regen values, as will units that have veterancy
    - this process removes the need to 'calculate' the regen value, in the UI, during any rollover
    - that was an intesive blueprint reading process in the past, that occurred super-frequently
    - units now carry around their current regen values as data, and pass it to the UI, via a SetStat process (thanks Jip)
    
    - Reclaiming times, and the process behind reclaim, got a close exam - detail in the loud-github-feed channel, on Discord
    - reclaim times for structures & units has always been correct - equal to build time (based on the buildpower of reclaimer)
    - reclaim times for props/wrecks are now 2x of normal build speed (ie. T1 Eng can build about 5 mass/tick - reclaim upto 10 mass/tick)

    - AI position, relative to loiter, checked more closely, to improve recall behavior when it strays

    - some logging to support some examination of some messy UI behavior that shows on very low game resolutions.
    - added a basic memory report to the game log file - it reports every 8 minutes - see github for more detail
    
MAPS
    - Armed & Dangerous updated with mass point revisions (Binary)
    
LAUNCHER FUNCTIONALITY

    - all the icon size files (Small,Medium & Large) are now stored in the BIN folder, where the launcher can move the selected file
    - the USERMODS folder will be used to house the set you are currently using so the updater won't overwrite your choice
    - the mounting sequence file has been adapted to see those files specifically and load them ahead of the imbedded icons


### Release 01-10-2022

Effects v3.2

    - new visual effect for the Miasma field (AEON BO ACU and BAL0402 Genesis)
    - mimics the size of field accurately to better represent the area of effect
    
Textures v6.7.3

    - new icons added for upcoming Attack-Move button orders
    - removal of long unused 'Hunker' button orders
    - addition of some DMS button order icons

LUA 6.2.16
LOUD_Misc 6.2.12
    
    - Resource Relocation will no longer do anything if NO AI are present in a game
    - The long standing T1 & T2 unit HP buffs (20% and 11% respectively) have been reduced to (12% and 6%)
    - game log will now report any units with misformed weapon range data
    - data streamlining and proper recording of the cheat driver values

    - AI DEBUG now has an option for tracking GUARDPOINT behavior
    - AI DEBUG now has an option for tracking WEAPON STATE changes (useful for debugging stalled weapons)
    - Weapon States, which could cause some weapons to shutdown during other weapons recharge phases, now fixed
    
    - MassPointShare, a value used by the AI to trigger stance change, lowered slightly for earlier aggression
    - MassPointList, which is a list of initial mass points, now directs Guardpoint thru the early game

    - AI Base radius adjusted down, should narrow base distress ranges
    - AI ACU Mass builder will now trigger at a lower point, allowing ACU to build early & replacement mass points
    - AI Outnumbered behavior now gets a very minor BuildRate boost
    - AI T1 Mass building engineers now 2 instances, instead of 1.
    - AI has minor revisions to shorten some of the early production queues for better economic response

    - BUFFFIELD structure changes allow removal of circular dependancies, and carry forward key data such as Radius and the VisualScale
    - BuffField blueprints for AEON Miasma field updated with new visual, slightly reduced range, increased consumption at top end

    - New Buff - MobilityPenalty, which will put a 4% mobility penalty on a unit - to be used in upcoming BO ACU revision
    - New Buff - ACU_T3_Intel_Package, which when used, gives most of the performance of a T3 OMNI station - to be used in upcoming BO ACU revision

    - revisions to the way buffs are done on ACU (multiples of the base rate now), small reduction in mass gained for top level engineering
    - this multiple method allows factional bonuses to come thru, resulting in a wider range of values for unit enhancements
    - mobility buffs will now appear briefly over units when applied, and whenever units take a mobility effect
    - errors with adjacency buffs being given to EngineerStations which were not eligible have been fixed
    
    - the unit 'orders' panel has been increased to 16 slots, from 12, for upcoming features
    - the presence of the 'Attack-Move' order is in place, but not yet functional
    - the Overcharge order will now always appear in the 4th slot - along with the other 'attack' orders
    
    - the unit 'details' panel will now more clearly show the actual regeneration rates after buffs, etc
    - as the buff happens, we record the updated regen on the unit, no longer needing to iterate the blueprint to find 'special' values
    
    - teleportation is now discounted by the amount of 'precharge' that units require
    - this effectively reduces the E required for any jump - especially for short ones.
    - the 'pre-charge' value is now relative to the amount of E storage that a unit may have (ACU)
    


### Release 12-08-2022

LUA 6.2.15

    - removed some redundant Campaign code (menus) and supporting modules that LOUD doesn't require
    
    - revised the 'Distress Response' for naval areas, will now properly evaluate HOVER units as threat and respond accordingly
    - Naval Rally Points and regular land-based Rally Points were interacting at ranges - land ones would overrule naval ones if found
        -- this was mostly an issue where a land base and a naval base or DP were in moderate proximity (less than 3k)

    - reviewed and revised all acceptable threat levels for engineer builds out in the open field to reduce suicidal engineer behaviors
    - looping engineers will now properly loop their mission if they break off a build due to threat, they'll find another suitable location (vs RTB)

    - LOUD will no longer build Experimental Artillery on 20k maps or smaller - this includes the Yolona Oss
    
    - minor change to how the ACU evaluates his condition when he has a shield (Einherjarn)
    
    - A revision to ALL air behaviors (Fighter, Bomber, Gunship & Torp) routines, making it more sensitive the long-range threats (threat modifier goes from .65 to .72)
    - revised the 'abort' routine for fighters (AirForceAILOUD) to widen the threat check radius while engaging a target (128 from 96)
    --   fighters should react better to being 'kited' over thick AA positions
    
    - revised the AI DEBUG option 'DistressResponseDialog' to give a more detailed report of DR activities by responding platoons    
    - revised the AI DEBUG option 'EngineerDialog' to give a more verbose trace of activities (great for finding issues, but VERY bulky in the LOG)
    --   for those wanting to learn about the AI process, this is an invaluable tool for seeing & tracking the processes a single engineer goes thru to build something
    



### Release 22-07-2022

LUA 6.2.14

    - fixed an issue with proper detection of amphibious presentations, resulted in overbuilding land-only units and restricted amphibious operations
    - fixed an issue with all 3 ratios where if the opponent loses all units (or doesn't build them) the respective ratio could drop to 0.011 (no enemy)
        -- this is directly opposite to the desired ratio of 10 (we've beaten the snot out of the opponent)
        -- greatly affects production choices (ie.- overbuild of ASF rather than going bombers/gunships)
    - initial air production has been revised to address all 3 opening needs (engineers, air scouts, air transport)
        -- dramatically restores his ability to move/expand quickly onto large maps and correctly identify opponents positions very early
    - PriorityFunctions, for the PlatoonFormManager (PFM), could reset builders with 0 priority (those to be removed), now ignores those
    - GUARDPOINT has a new option for PointSort -- MostThreat - allowing platoons to pick a point that is most threatened (useful for MEX Guard)
        - MostThreat is utilized by FindPointMeetsConditions() to sort the final point list by highest threat first
    - the MapLessThan20km function was using the wrong value (was not recognizing 20k maps properly)
    - AI Assist functions now have a higher default gating value (250M, 1250E) and will cycle on 3 second period, down from 4
    - AI SelfUpgrade function will now prioritize T3 Pgen Upgrades more aggressively than T2, but both have had their test frequency increased
    - A wide range of adjusted economic triggers for all kinds of engineer work (see Github for greater details)
    - A revised and narrower schedule of T4 builds, to encourage more assist of current projects, rather than starting more new ones




### Release 16-07-2022

LUA 6.2.13

    - fixed a divide by zero error affecting the strength ratio calculations
    - store intermediate cheat values (MinorCheatModifier, MajorCheatModifier) to be used elsewhere as modifiers 
    - air strength ratio now evaluating enemy bomber/gunships at full, allied only at half - this helps LOUD better identify enemy bomber/gunship concentration
    
    - added some new GUARDPOINT features to control point finding at short distances, and the use of MergePlanMatch during merge operations in that behavior
        -- allows guarding of points much closer to a base without false exit triggering
        -- allows tightly controlling merge operations so that they only merge with platoons that not only use the same behavior, but the same builder (ie. - MEX Guard)
        -- retreating platoons will still attempt free-range merge_into operations with almost any other platoon nearby
        -- fine tuning of most GUARDPOINT using formations, there were some whose base conditions didn't match with the builder data
        -- the MEX GUARD formation gets most benefit from this, and we have reviewed its formation sizes and priority, we should see him more actively guarding extractors
        -- the supporting FindPointMeetsConditions() function gets logging (outcommented) to allow detailed tracking of the filtering process
    
    - revised the SelfUpgrade process for more accurate trend prediciton, use of actual buildtime in the delay process, impacted by eco storage conditions
        -- process now ages older incomplete upgrades by slightly lowering trend requirements, making them more likely to pass eco checks as they age
        -- moving the upgrade requirement multipliers up, this stabilizes his economy at a higher point, which keeps factories running almost 100% of the time as result
        -- this was stressing him last week, as sometimes he couldn't transition into T3, resources were too tight - this patch should fix that nicely
        -- greatly improved the LOG dialog for Structure Upgrades, the AI logging funcion gives you detailed tracking of the decision process if you wish to see it at work
    
    - wide ranging additional eco and ratio conditions for engineer builds, assisting, factory production and land formations
    - adopting the 'outnumbered' approach to the initial naval base build - permitting a T1 engineer to start it earlier but with the minimal build
    - a full revision of SACU eco requirements for most of their builds, insuring that key decision points sit on similar eco conditions for more unpredictability
    - a revision of the eco requirements for adding new factories, he's a little slower in adding more, but this prevents premature eco crashing
    - mass fabricators will appear earlier and more agressively, and his drive to build power infrastructure will keep pace with this demand
    
    - alteration to the lobby code to track observers, and deal with observers causing a crash when exiting an ongoing game (unsuccessful)
    
    


### Release 09-07-2022

LUA 6.2.12

    - expanded functionality for both Assisting & LoopBuilding engineer, allowing fine control of economic parameters for break-off
    - greatly expanded AI postions for T1 Pgens and T2 as well - resequenced for better adjacency during early game
    - using new assist functionality in AI assist energy tasks (ACU as well) permits more focused assisting for energy builds
    - a complete review on the focus of early power building - providing a more robust energy base for growth early in the game
    - mass building gets a full review as well, introducing some economic curbs on building more mass, especially tuned to the power systems
    - the economic triggers which allow many defense builders have been synced to those used by factories, but insuring continued unit production
    - engineers have been using 'attack-move' for several months now - this ability is now forced thru a field in the builder data - default is off otherwise
    - a flaw in the logic of LandStrengthRatioGreaterThan() was corrected (courtesy of Einherjarn)
    - T1 transports will no longer be built in advance - the builder will only be activated if a request has been made that could not be fullfilled
    - Walls will no longer grant kills towards veterancy




### Release 30-06-2022

LUA 6.2.11

    - Another hotfix for MetalWorld
    - MetalWorld now simulates 9 MEX for each original mass point - up from 5
    - Minor ACU behavioral change - ACU will keep his MEX building task all game now - corrected threat parameter
    - ACU T1 Pgen building will now continue - if needed - until T3 appears
    - Skirmish platoons (guards) have had their merge values slightly reduced, to keep more platoons in the field
    - Some of the Distress parameters have been adjusted - to reduce the response range - but respond to lower threat triggers
    - The CallForHelpAI parameters for MEX and HYDRO units - has had the threat trigger lowered from 3 to 1.5 (should pickup armed scouts, LABS)
    - The T1MassGuard formation has it's maximum formation reduced from 5 to 4 to increase formation frequency, but of potentially smaller size

    - Overhaul of the logging for transport functions, and elimination of some edge conditions that leave transports 'stalled'
    - some tweaks for base defense requirements, T1 defense reclaim will now collect walls
    - the odd 'disappearing decals' problem appears to be resolved
    - the LOG entries for ACT actions have been structured for consistency 

    - 1st pass of a new 'Teleport' mechanic
        - teleportation now has an 'optimal range' set in the unit blueprint (for those that can teleport)
        - teleports shorter or longer than the optimal range are less 'efficient'
        - maximum range is no longer entirely hard-capped but, for now, set at about X2 of previous values
        - teleport costs (and the time it takes to charge) will grow VERY quickly beyond optimal range
        - teleport charge time is now related to build power, rate capped just like in Evenflow - more build power == faster teleport
        - the 'burst' charge (about 4k E) is collected up front, before actually teleporting - no longer expended unless teleport works
        - at this time, that mechanic has NOT been applied to 'teleportation structures' - pending results

- BrewLAN Cityscapes now has settings:
 |--> Choose where cities spawn.
 |--> (Be warned: putting cities in "Occupied" start locations tends to break the AI.)
 |--> Choose whether cities in player start locations belong to that player.
 |--> Choose the size of cities ("Small" is recommended for maps over 20x20km to prevent lag).
- New mod: BrewLAN Bletchley Park. A rebalance which separates Tech 3 Radar and Omni Sensors into two different buildings per faction (except Seraphim).
 |--> This mod also adds the Teatut; a UEF Experimental Mobile Omni Sensor, which works only in one direction at a time.
- New mod: BrewLAN Metal World.
 |--> Another "mutator" mod like those added recently; removes all mass points and allows building mass extractors anywhere.
- New mod: BrewLAN Wonky Resources.
 |--> Allows building resource extractors (i.e. mass extractors and hydrocarbon plants) on terrain regardless of roughness.
 |--> Useful for maps with resource points which previously had too much slope to build on.
- New mod: No VO Alerts. Choose to disable the following voice-over alerts:
 |--> Whenever one of your mass extractors gets attacked.
 |--> Whenever you establish a new ferry route.
 |--> Whenever an enemy ACU enters your vision.
- New mod: Beta integration of HotStats by Saya and Zulan.
 |--> Warning: heavily affects performance. It's recommended that it be used in replays only.
- Improvements to AI chat commands.
 |--> If "aimult", "aicheat", or "ailevel" appears in a message to "All", every AI will tell their cheat multiplier.
 |--> "give me an engineer" has been replaced to only look for the word "engi", and only in whispers.
- The AI now:
 |--> Keeps better intel on moving threats.
 |--> More finely stores positions of threats on maps 40x40km and larger.
 |--> Better adapts to obstructive terrain when engaging targets.
 |--> Builds mass extractors using its ACU, but only within the first 5 minutes of a game.
 |--> Has a new, larger anti-air attack platoon, which replaces "AA Attack Water".
 |--> Has had small increases to the maximum size of its smaller platoons, allowing for larger formations. 
 |--> Will build power generators sooner if absolutely necessary.
 |--> Will be more likely to choose targets in a more aggressive manner.
- King Kraptor (Aeon Experimental Abomination Bot) w looks a little bit more "Aeon", thanks to Balthazar.
- Descriptions for units from LOUD Unit Additions and Integrated Storage have been cleaned up somewhat.
- Make the lobby colour wheel look a little bit better.
- The Purifier (Aeon Tech 3 Advanced Tactical Missile Launcher) is working again.
- Fix: Re-hide "Game Speed" lobby option (it's always "Adjustable" in LOUD).
- Fix: Ensure proper colour transfer, prevent errors when changing from player to observer in the lobby.
- Fix: Prevent entering a negative Timed Cheat Limit (this should never have been possible, and would break the game).
- Fix: Make feedback- and time-based cheating add together properly (timed would briefly override feedback). 
- Fix: Starting location markers in the lobby Map Preview didn't have colours.
- Fix: The Conquest Class (UEF Experimental Battleship) will no longer try to shoot at satellites with its anti-air guns.
- Fix: Some maps could not show a minimap or cartographic view. Thanks to code from FAF, this has been resolved.
- Fix: Arrow key scrolling through the map selection list doesn't reset upon selecting a folder anymore.


### Patch 06-02-2021 ###
Lua 5.4.06

- AI: Revision of threat-driven Naval bases.
 |--> Avoids building naval bases if threat too near.
 |--> Naval builders for small maps use different range values in this threat-based assessment.
 |--> Expansion bases use more threat-driven triggers to suppress construction of certain defensive works.
 |--> Naval Reinforcement now triggered by lower requirements.
- AI: Threat Build conditions revised.


### Release 05-02-2021 ###
Lua 5.4.05

- A large number of BrewLAN "mutator" mods have been added to the mod pack.
 |--> All of these are work-in-progress, so let us know in the Discord or ModDB if anything doesn't work.
 |--> Many are unbalanced on purpose. Your mileage may vary.
 |--> The craziest of them can be found under the "Mutators" folder in the mod manager, but some are under "Unofficial Rebalances".
 |--> There are a total of 16, so for more information on them, read their descriptions from the mod manager.
- UI Party has been compatibilized for LOUD; its beta release is in this update.
 |--> Almost all of its settings are off by default.
- New UI mod: Disperse Move.
 |--> Give a group of units a queue of move orders, then use a hotkey to distribute the orders among them.
 |--> Useful to, for example, order several recon planes to fly over a large area.
- Major upgrades to the keybinding menu (accessed by pressing the F1 key).
 |--> All categories are now folders.
 |--> Button to remove a key from an action without changing it to a different key.
 |--> Search for a key or action by name.
 |--> Whenever an action was re-bound or unbound, the old key would still work until the game was restarted. This has been fixed.
 |--> When re-assigning a key, the GUI will now tell you what other action that key is currently bound to.
 |--> Keybindings with no description will now show their internal ID instead of "No Action Text".
- Accuracy and Damage Boost Nodes (BrewLAN) cap cost increases: 0.25 -> 1.
- AI: A new platoon function to monitor platoon size, used to monitor air platoons during combat to affect retreat behaviour.
- The package "loud_mods.scd" has been split into "loud_units.scd" and "loud_misc.scd".
 |--> This is so that the units pack files don't have to be updated when changes are made to small mods, such as UI.
 |--> This has no impact on the user experience or the game.
- Fix a lobby bug which caused either the lobby to crash, or an infinite loading screen.
- Fix a bug where the unit cap text box in the lobby would revert back to its previous value when scrolling.
- Lobby column headers now have text shadows so they're a little easier to read.
- Mod manager folders are now hidden if they're empty.
- Tiny improvement to the speed at which the mod manager opens.
- Reduce some file redundancy in LOUD Structure Enhancements.
 |--> Since the Advanced Stealth Field Generators added by this mod are upscales of existing units, they no longer have copies of their meshes, textures, and animations.
 |--> This has no effect on game performance or appearance, except for saving about 8 MB of RAM.
- Now that BrewLAN Baristas is under the "Miscellaneous" folder, its "UTIL" prefix is redundant, and has been removed.


### Patch 01-02-2021 ###
Lua 5.4.04

- Fix the mod manager getting stuck on Lucky Dip.
- Fix crashes when trying to start a multiplayer lobby.
- A preset saved after the last update would enable no mods when loaded. This has been fixed.

- Unit database improvements:
 |--> Show a unit's icon background in its details display.
 |--> Show max ammunition count for applicable weapons (e.g. nukes and antinukes).
 |--> Show a unit's storage capacities if it has any.
 |--> Fix a bug which caused certain weapons not show up.
- Mod manager improvements:
 |--> Give folders their own colour to make them appear more distinct from mods.
 |--> Collapse Mutators and Miscellaneous folders by default.
 |--> Double-clicking no longer shows mod details (since this tended to happen by accident). Instead, right-clicking does this.
 |--> Usermods get sorted alphabetically.
 |--> Folders have tooltips to better explain them.


### Release 30-01-2021 ###
Lua 5.4.03
Textures 6.3.1
LOUD Mods 5.4

- Mod manager revamp. More list items visible at once, and more detailed information on any given mod. 
- The lobby now allows players to choose their colours via a colour wheel.

- The unit cap lobby option is now a textbox, which can take any number between 350 and 5000.
- New setting under Options -> Interface: Land Unit Selection Priority.
 |--> When this function is enabled, trying to select both air and land units will remove air units from the final selection.
 |--> Holding shift will temporarily disable this function.
- New mutator mod: Tanksy's Experiments 1: Combat Changes.
 |--> This mod is for users who want more realistic ranges in their games; unit ranges vary from 2 to 3 times their original values.
 |--> Changes are also made to muzzle velocities and weapon firing arcs to account for these range differences.
- Fixed d3d_WindowsCursor getting turned off (and thus bringing back the NVIDIA driver lag bug) every second match started per application session.
- AI: a revision to how PriorityFunctions are handled by the PlatoonFormManager.
 |--> Previously, PFM tasks did NOT get PriorityFunction reviews unless the PFM tasks were sorted.
 |--> This only occured when the primary status of the location changed (not very often).
 |--> Now - they are processed, inline with the PFM looking for builders to fill.
- AI: Engineer defense tasks have had their priorities modified.
- AI: Standard air behavior now gets the same kind of target setup as bombers and gunships, with limited split attack ability.
 |--> Various tweaks to fighter formations for longer search radius, target priority.
- Fixed chat text not wrapping properly.
- Renamed multiple LOUD mini-mods.
 |--> "Enhanced Commanders" is now "Enhanced Black Ops Commanders" for clarity.

- All unit wrecks have 60% of their previous value to reduce penalization for aggressive play.
- Fix Unit Database (under Main Menu -> Extras) not having a background panel (and thus make it usable).
- The LOUD Standard button no longer enables Barista, Supreme Economy, Auto Mass Fab Manager and Sequential Mex Upgrade.
- Made the Sequential Mex Upgrade tooltip more accurate. Thanks to MostLostNoob#6672.
- AI: Engineers' sensitivity to nearby threat has been tuned. Threat must now be closer (400 <- 450) and larger (75 <- 30) to trigger most defensive land defence builders.
- AI: Moved the triggers for some engineer functions and several land formations based upon land ratio, keeping them in action a little longer.
- AI: Small increase in radius of base patrol (was running into the perimeter defenses).
- AI: Allowing T3 construction to continue to a slightly higher ratio and curbing T3 MML production at an earlier point.
- AI: A general reduction in the size of reinforcement platoons and the introduction of a SUPPORT reinforcement, to complement the DIRECTFIRE and INDIRECTFIRE platoons.

- Unit Database. Under Main Menu -> Extras, this is a screen that allows searching through and reading detailed information on all the units in the LOUD mod pack.
- BrewLAN RNG: Lucky Dip. A mod by Balthazar which, for each player, restricts the player from building all but one unit of any given type.
 |--> For example, out of the 4 Tech 3 Anti-Air units the UEF has, a UEF player will only be able to build 1.
 |--> Currently requires all of the unit mods included with LOUD as standard.
 |--> The LOUD port of this mod is in an alpha version, and subject to change. Feedback is appreciated as always.
- The economy of artillery has been overhauled. Energy consumption of artillery weapons is now formulaically derived from their damage and area-of-effect. This results in many weapons consuming more energy.
- Mild increases to energy storage for almost all energy related buildings, including mass fabricators. Seraphim buildings benefit more from these buffs.
- The fake UEF Tech 3 Sonar is no longer in the Seraphim unit roster as an upgrade to the Sera T2 Sonar. It has been replaced with BrewLAN's Sera T3 Sonar.

 |--> Cloaking now passively costs 275 energy per second.
 |--> All veterancy requirements multiplied by 1.4.
 |--> Damage multiplier versus shields reduced from 0.8 to 0.5.
 |--> Energy cost per shot increased from 0 to 24150 (drained at 2300 per second), resulting in a 10.5 second charge cycle before firing.
 |--> Acceleration reduced from 0.8 to 0.6 o-grids per second squared.
 |--> Maximum speed increased from 2.4 to 2.7 o-grids per second.
 |--> Maximum brake speed reduced from 2.4 to 0.9 o-grids per second.
 |--> Turn rate reduced from 20 to 17 degrees per second.
- Minor adjustments to costs of T1 engineers and factories.
 |--> T1 Land Fac mass cost 240 -> 250.

 |--> Build cost reduction; 180 to 120 mass, 5400 to 3700 energy.
 |--> Sonar radius brought down from 210 to 180.
 |--> Vision radius increased from 22 to 30.
 |--> Water vision radius reduced from 35 to 15.
- Fixed some AI base creation and timing problems.
- Make AI build more shields when it is losing the land battle.
- Make AI build more AA when it is losing the air battle.
- Fixed issues preventing the AI from building any naval bases on 10km x 10km maps.
- Make the AI keep Tech 2 and Tech 3 production going longer if it is winning the land battle.
- AI: Some of the threat logic behind alerts and build conditions now factor in AI cheat multiplier, distance, and the AI's land ratio. 
- A triple wrench icon now indicates the build power statistic in the unit mouseover details.
- Custom lobby options packaged with maps will show under the header "Map Options" instead of "Advanced".

- Large-scale reorganization of AI unit compositions and building priorities.


### Release 18-12-2020 ###
Lua 5.3.30

- Automatic call of a console command to fix performance problems related to recent NVIDIA driver updates.
- AI multipliers can now be set via a text box.
- Time-based adaptive cheat can now work negatively, allowing an AI to become an easier opponent as the game progresses. This can make for a more potent early game -- when LOUD is normally most vulnerable -- while “levelling out” with players in the middle and later games, when LOUD’s advantages begin to add up.
- All the most advanced AI lobby options are now in their own category at the bottom of the list.
- Feedback-based adaptive cheat, when combined with time-based adaptive cheat, now works based on the current actual cheat instead of the cheat which the AI started with.

- AI: Some adjustments to maximum unit counts for various unit types.
- AI: Bombardment groups will now form at ratios of 1 or greater (down from 1.5)
- AI: Naval reinforcement requirements lowered slightly.
- AI: Improved air staging.
- AI: Improved reaction time of base distress responses.
- Base Alerts will prevent the Dead Base Monitor from closing a base until the alerts have expired. This was causing a fair number of alert units to get 'stuck' at a base that was closed during an alert.
- AI pings are somewhat less intrusive.
- AI: A very minor reduction in how much threat transport platoons will accept.
- AI: Some adjustment to bomber formations, requirements and targeting conditions, tether ranges, etc.
