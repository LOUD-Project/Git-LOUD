- AI can now adapt its multiplier in response to certain factors.If the corresponding lobby global option is set to "Time-Based", the AI will increase its multiplier by 0.02 every 6 minutes. If the option is set to "Ratio-Based", all AI will increase their multipliers up to a max of 0.5 based on the relative size of their land army ratio to that of their enemies.
- New AI multiplier options: 1.45 and 2.5.

- Simplified some factory unit construction conditions.
- The UsingTransports flag will prevent a platoon from being considered during MERGE operations.
- New custom behaviour for torpedo bomber platoons.
- Removed some deprecated platoon categories.
- Correct RTBLocation to keep platoons from always defaulting to the origin base.
