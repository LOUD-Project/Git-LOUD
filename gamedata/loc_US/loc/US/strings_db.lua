In such event, you must destroy all copies of this Software and all of its component parts.\n\n15. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

Any assignment in violation of this Agreement is void, except that you may transfer your Software to another person provided that person accepts the terms of this License Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such decision shall not affect the enforceability of: (i) such provision under other circumstances, or (ii) the remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances. THQ's failure to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provisions, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by THQ of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, no default, delay or failure to perform on the part of THQ shall be considered a breach of this Agreement if such default, delay or failure to perform is shown to be due to causes beyond the reasonable control of THQ.

SCMP_001_Description="Initial scans of the planet revealed evenly spaced hills, leading some to believe that the hills were ancient alien burial mounds. Subsequent scans disproved this theory, but many believe that the old Earth Empire actually found alien remains, spirited them away and then faked the scans as part of the cover-up."
SCMP_002_Description="Not technically a lake, but rather an upwelling of gases that have combined to form a 'water-like' liquid. Most of the gases are unknown and all three factions are eager to exploit the area and discover its secrets."
SCMP_003_Description="Named after a long-dead Imperial officer, Drake was sent in to quell a secessionist movement and found himself facing an organized army. He was forced to retreat to the opposite ridge of the ravine, and it was at that position he was able to get enough units online to fight back. Drake defeated the secessionists and the ravine has since borne his name."
SCMP_004_Description="Underwater for millennia, tectonic shifts have drained the Crater, exposing the Mass needed to continue the Infinite War. Sparse forests have sprung up in the intervening years, though they are often destroyed in the continuous fighting that rages in the Crater."
SCMP_005_Description="Once a haven for smugglers, the islands were named after the 'gentlemen' that did business there. Now the islands host a different kind of gentleman, Commanders from the three factions who vie with each other for control of the planet."
SCMP_006_Description="Named for an early explorer, Ian's Cross has witnessed countless battles. The relatively open area and plentiful Mass deposits have encouraged continual battles for several years."
SCMP_007_Description="A small strip of green surrounded by ice and snow, no one is really sure who first called this area Open Palms. Legend has it that originally this was neutral ground, where soldiers of any faction could come without fear of attack. Hence, all who came had 'open palms,' meaning no weapons were carried."
SCMP_008_Description="For years, these glaciers had been mined by the Aeon, who gave them their name. However, with the ebb and flow of battle, the Aeon have been driven off and the glaciers will belong to whomever can hold them."
SCMP_009_Description="Dozens of battles have been fought over the years across Seton's Clutch. A patient searcher could find the remains of thousands of units resting beneath the earth and under the waves."
SCMP_010_Description="A warlord called Sung once called this island home. He chose it for both its great beauty and abundant resources. Sung has long since been driven off, but the resources remain for whoever can take them."
SCMP_011_Description="Once a small continent, the UEF constructed a research base here for advanced weapons testing. The researchers lost control of an experimental weapon and the resulting explosion decimated the continent, ripping it into a few scattered islands. Now all three factions are attempting to find evidence of this weapon for their own purposes."
SCMP_012_Description="In the early days of the settlement, wayfarers knew to go through the arch and head due north to reach civilization. These days, the Passage is much more dangerous, thanks to the constant fighting that moves back and forth across the desert."
SCMP_013_Description="Sometimes two Commanders need a private place to conduct a private fight. Winter Duel is the arena of choice when the battle has become personal."
SCMP_014_Description="Old mariner's tales speak of the Bermuda Triangle, where ships would disappear without a trace. The Bermuda Locket has much the same reputation, save that it's Commanders who never return."
SCMP_015_Description="With almost no water and little vegetation, there is very little reason to come to the Fields. However, it does possess abundant Mass , which makes it a natural place for Commanders to fight."
SCMP_016_Description="Canis River is known for two things. The first is the river, which is home to mineral deposits, especially gold. The second is that it's ideal for a one-on-one fight."
SCMP_017_Description="This place is unremarkable in every respect. However, it does sit on a major Gate hub, offering easy access to a good portion of the galaxy. For this reason alone, many Commanders have fought to the death to claim this place."
SCMP_018_Description="When this region was originally settled, towers were placed on the hill to keep watch over the area. It became known as Sentry Point, a name it has kept long after the people who named it had gone."
SCMP_019_Description="Many years ago, a Commander called Finn was defeated and forced to flee. He later drew his opponent to a small island and defeated him. The island has held his name ever since."
SCMP_020_Description="An unnatural, sunken area of an otherwise normal ocean, many believe the Abyss was created by aliens for some unknown purpose. Though disproved by scientific surveys, the mere rumor of possible alien technology is enough for all three factions to fight savagely for control of the area."
SCMP_021_Description="Flagged 'hazard' by the old Earth Empire, Alpha 7 has been quarantined for hundreds of years. Only now have the factions begun to wonder why. Did it contain aliens, some sort of plague or virus? No one knows, but the factions are willing to fight to find out."
SCMP_022_Description="The only hospitable spot on an otherwise desolate ice planet, the Refuge is unremarkable, save that if a Gate could be built there, it would make an excellent staging area for further operations."
SCMP_023_Description="Often the fight for a world comes down to a single battle. All the maneuvering, strategy and preparation culminate in one final brawl. Victory at Varga Pass means victory over an entire planet."
SCMP_024_Description="No one knows how the shape of this particular land mass was created. Many theories have been proposed, but the answer will probably never be known."
SCMP_025_Description="The only viable land located in a vast sea, the Colony has seen more than its fair share of war. Now deserted, Commanders still come to determine who can claim Saltrock Colony."
SCMP_026_Description="Vya-3 was once a haven from war. The clouds of red dust choked intake vents and shorted circuit boards, stopping even the mightiest army in its tracks. New technology, however, allows units to operate in this unforgiving environment, and now battle has returned to the red plains."
SCMP_027_Description="Surrounded by lava, the Scar is little more than an outcropping of rock that hasn't yet been consumed by the fire around it. Despite its dangerous environment, it does possess significant mineral deposits, which draw Commanders from all over to battle for its riches."
SCMP_028_Description="Once the home of exclusive resorts and expensive spas, the Oasis was the playground of the rich and connected. Yachts plied the water and presidents could be seen mingling with business tycoons. The Aeon eventually found the Oasis and destroyed the resorts, building temples in their places. Now, many years later, the Infinite War has come again to the Oasis."
SCMP_029_Description="Classified"
SCMP_030_Description="Originally a staging ground for UEF naval unit testing, the planet was overrun by the Aeon many years ago. Now it lies in contested territory and Commanders from all over come to try and claim it."
SCMP_031_Description="The Cybrans thought they were lucky to find such a pristine, resource-rich area to build a new settlement. The Aeon, however, quickly appeared, followed closely by the UEF. Now the settlement will be lucky to survive the ravages of the Infinite War."
SCMP_032_Description="In a different age, the Wilderness might have been a nature preserve. With its waterways and thick forests, life of all kinds flourished. The Wilderness, though, had the misfortune to be chosen as a Gate hub. Its forests now echo with the crash of weapons fire and the waterways are clogged with the hulls of broken warships."
SCMP_033_Description="White Fire was a secret Aeon naval base. The Aeon built hundreds of ships and then unleashed them upon their unsuspecting enemies. They almost took the planet, but the UEF rallied, struck back and eventually White Fire was destroyed. Now, years later, the war has returned to the area and everyone is determined to claim the base for themselves."
SCMP_034_Description="The gunslingers are long gone, but Commanders looking for a showdown know they'll find one at High Noon."
SCMP_035_Description="The first explorers to find this place thought they had found paradise. The warm water, cool breezes and miles of beaches were a welcome respite in a harsh galaxy. Word spread and soon everyone wanted a little piece of Paradise. "
SCMP_036_Description="The mining colony at Blasted Rock had hoped that they could find riches beneath the sand. However, word soon spread about the rich mineral deposits and now the colony has to fight just to survive."
SCMP_037_Description="The thick, brackish water clings to everything, staining anything it touches. If it weren't for this planet's proximity to the Quarantine Zone, no one would ever bother coming here."
SCMP_038_Description="Bandits used to lurk in the area, watching the road that wound between the hills. The bandits are long since gone, but the Pass is still a favorite spot for a fight."
SCMP_039_Description="A former UEF naval testing ground, the UEF used to set up targets on land and bombard them with a variety of vessels. The facilities have long since been abandoned, but the wealth of data and ruined units has drawn Commanders from each faction."
SCMP_040_Description="Devoid of any atmosphere, vegetation or animal life, the Ditch is the last place anyone would want to go. However, it does have amazingly rich mineral deposits, which makes it worth fighting for."
