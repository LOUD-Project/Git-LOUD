# UEF Faction Cohesion

Please note that air is not considered; although the ASF has cannons instead of rockets.

# Conclusions

- Whilst the UEF utilizes rockets as Anti-Air, there is no vanilla unit that uses them as ground-firing weapons (mostly mod units of questionable quality do);
- The UEF's signature moves are plasma gatling (blue machinegun...) / Machingun / Plasma Cannon / Antimatter / Napalm (including throwers);
- UEF thrives on slow, tanksy platoons;
- UEF Naval is (should be) the most badass (support battleship, battlecruiser, battleship, shield boats);

Naval:
All AA is flak apart from T2 cruiser (vanilla) / Support cruiser (wyv).
Beams and cannons for weapons.
Dreadnaught has gauss apparently.

# Recommendations RD

## PD

**T3 PD Rocket Pad** - Cull - This unit is so out of line, it's hilarious. Balance aside, it is not close to UEF anything and is 100% cybran.

**Hellstorm Emplacement** - Cull - Doesn't really add anything over T2 Artillery, is inaccurate, just clutters the lineup.

**Angry Ace VS Tower Boss** - Cull one - (i vote to cull plasma tower)

- Angry Ace is in line with UEF with it's moderate cannons / has accuracy issues, missing targets standing still _a lot_;
- Plasma tower projectiles are more t3/t4-like than t2. More blocky approach is more UEF probably. Definately punching above its weight visually, shouldn't be T2;

**Brimstone** - Visual noise - Reduce explosion effect in size and get it inline with the AoE (3 - too muc anyway, but it's that right now). Has nothing competing in it's class. Ravager is the direct antiphasis. (gatling vs cannons);

**Barrage artillery** - Add napalm / Antimatter effects - Would make it more distinct from other factions;

## Land

**Helltank / Jugger** - Add Torpedoes(-defense) to jugger and remove rockets. This diversifies the roles of these very similar units; / Remove Amph from Helltank

- Helltank railgun is a major part of the units strength and uniqueness;
- Juggernaut has less HP than helltank if you combine HP + shield. This wass not the original intention;

**Banshee** - Commision a replacement - It's quite bad. It's visually less pleasing than it's counterparts (dervish / immortal) and is basically a bad Cybran Immortal;

- It's machineguns miss often;
- Get rid of deathsound if not culled;

**Rapid assault (Statue / Warhammer / Bull)** - cull

- all three are visually noisy;
- Not very UEF. They are fast and less resilient, which is not UEF;
- Bull has EMP. Should not be there, that's a cybran thing;
- Unappealing models;
- Very dependant on rockets which are not UEF

**Rommel** - unsure

- Visually pleasing, but underwhelming compared to all other t3 MOD units (better fit alongside titan/percival);
- Mammoth tank from CNC3

**T3 Land AA** - Cull Hermes and Banisher - Add Amphib to cougar

- Cougar is the most diversifying unit;
- 3 AA Sam units
- Tanksy doesn't like Cougar as hes afraid it's inaccurate; it's not. If it is, fix it.
- MostLostNoob wants to keep the Radar one.

**Walrus** - cull - Add amph to demolisher

- Although i like the walrus more, it doesn't really anything. Add Amph to demolisher

**Star Adder** - Cull

- Not a UEF unit. It was intended for cybran. Blood Asp fulfills it's role better with beams (lambda..)

**Rampage** - Cull - Goofy unit with aiming problems

**Goliath** - Cull

- The dragonite is the real UEF abom judging by it's weapons;
- Visually noisy
- Wrong tooltip

**Mayhem** - Cull

- TML weapons are goofy (trajectory and all that);
- Splashes own units/buildings when firing at something behind it;
- A beefed up spearhead with other roles covered by dragonite better;

**Wyvern (2)** - Cull one

- We've already removed the 4th fatboy. Now theres 3 left.
- Wyvern 1 is more UEF. It's a beefed up fatboy without fact.
- Wyvern 2 is the SC2 thing. Longer range or not, having 3 of the same thing is clutter.

**Owens** - Cull - doesn't bring much to the table. Has cybran weaponry. Cull;
